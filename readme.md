##Introduction
This repository is a fork of the late [Jim Weirich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Weirich)'s [gitimmersion tutorial](http://gitimmersion.com/index.html). It exists because there is does not appear to be an official repository for bug reports. As Git evolves, bugs in the original tutorial become more likely.
##Philosophy
Generally, the approach is conserve to Weirich's implmentation. The appropriate changes are deemed to be: 

1. Patch only what needs to be patched in Weirich's implementation. 

2. In order to make the changes accessible to a wide audience, maintain a stand alone version hosted on Github pages.

3. To support non-English versions of Weirich's tutorial.
