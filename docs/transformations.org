#+TITLE: transformations
* Introduction
This document contains a set of scripts to transform Git Immersion to be better hosted on Github.
* Remove Google Analytics
There is no reason to continue to call on Google analytics using Weirich's key. And little reason to contiue to use Google Analyitics at all since the goal is stability rather than modifications to increase engagement.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :noweb tangle :tangle remove-google-analytics.sh
  <<remove-google-analytics>> ../index.html
  <<remove-google-analytics>> ../html/lab_*html
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

** sed command
#+NAME: remove-google-analytics
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sed -n '/<script type="text\/javascript">/,+9d'
#+END_SRC

* Update reference to index.html
Version 2 of Git Immersion places index html in the root directory rather than the =html= subdirectory. This facilitates hosting using Github's /pages/ feature (placing index.html in the root of the repository is one of three options for hosting).

** sed command
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :tangle update-index-dot-html.sh
  cd ..
  sed -e 's/index\.html/\.\.\/index\.html/d' html/lab_*html
#+END_SRC
